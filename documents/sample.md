# Sample Markdown Document

This is a sample document that can be used for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in the AI Agent Server project. 

## Introduction

This document serves as an example of how markdown/text documents can be structured for embedding and retrieval purposes. 

## Key Concepts

1. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: A method that enhances the generation of responses by retrieving relevant information from a set of documents.
2. **Session Memory**: The ability to remember past interactions within a session to provide contextually relevant responses.

## Example Content

- **Topic 1**: Understanding RAG
  - RAG combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to improve the quality of AI-generated responses.

- **Topic 2**: Session Management
  - Effective session management allows for personalized interactions by remembering user inputs and preferences.

## Conclusion

This sample document is intended to be loaded into the AI Agent Server to demonstrate the functionality of the RAG system. Additional documents can be added to enhance the knowledge base of the AI agent.
